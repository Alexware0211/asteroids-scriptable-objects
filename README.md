I had to rework everything I had due to me ignoring to push to github thus when I encountered a weird issue that caused my entire project not to work I had to redo
everything from scratch on the final day. As it currently is, the tools and stats around the player do not work. I originally intended to make it work but due to a lack of time as this needs to be done soon I see no point in trying to stress it to make it work.
